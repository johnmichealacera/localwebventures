# Anti-Spam Protection Guide

## What We've Implemented

### 1. **Honeypot Field** üï∑Ô∏è
- Added a hidden "website" field that bots often fill out
- If this field is filled, the form submission is blocked
- Real users won't see or fill this field

### 2. **Required "How Did You Hear About Us?" Field** üìç
- Bots typically don't answer contextual questions
- Real prospects will select an option
- Helps identify legitimate leads

### 3. **Enhanced Validation** ‚úÖ
- Name length validation (2-50 characters)
- Email format validation
- Required field validation
- Trims whitespace from all inputs

### 4. **Formspree Integration** üîó
- Form submissions go directly to Formspree
- Built-in spam detection on their end
